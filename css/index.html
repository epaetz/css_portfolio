        <p>A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history–with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila. (Mitch Radcliffe) I’ve noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world has almost entirely disappeared from the common culture. Near as I can tell, this coincides with the release of MS-DOS. (Larry DeLuca) The Web is like a dominatrix. Everywhere I turn, I see little buttons ordering me to Submit. (Nytwind) If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside. (Robert X. Cringely).</p>
        <p>Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file. (Louis Srygley) The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. (Randall E. Stross) </p>

          <p>In software, we rarely have meaningful requirements. Even if we do, the only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the customer’s shifting idea of what their problem is. (Jeff Atwood) I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) Any fool can use a computer. Many do. (Ted Nelson) Every operating system out there is about equal… We all suck. (Microsoft senior vice president Brian Valentine describing the state of the art in OS security, 2003) First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. (George Carrette)</p>

          <p>December 2023</p>
          <p>To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. (Paul Ehrlich) If McDonalds were run like a software company, one out of every hundred Big Macs would give you food poisoning, and the response would be, ‘We’re sorry, here’s a coupon for two more.’ (Mark Minasi) It’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature. (Anonymous) If Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution. (Robert Sewell) Good code is its own best documentation. (Steve McConnell)</p>
